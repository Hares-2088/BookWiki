This is my first full-stack project. I chose to make a website that is like GoodReads. You can get information about the books and the authors that I put. You can see what books an author has written and you can also go the other way around and see which author did which book.

## CRUD
With this project, I learnt all the basic crud operations connected to the local database, so I can now add, update, and delete.

# Website
### The main page of my website shows the fantasy books in a carousel
